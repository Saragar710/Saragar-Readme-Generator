# Saragar Readme Generator

## Description

This project will help you understand node. By reading the documentation there are alot of different things you can do with node. It is quite interesting.  This readme generator also helps you find a faster way to create a professional readme file by simply following the prompted questions. Which of course you can change to fit your project.  I now have a better understanding of JavaScript(writing functions with less lines of code(Thank you Sandy!)), I now know how to install Inquiere and see all the cool things you can do with that. And I also learned how to use markdown. I will of course need more practice with these new techniques.
